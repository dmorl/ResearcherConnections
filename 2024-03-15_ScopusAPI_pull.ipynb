    "#### <b> Last Updated: 2024-04-22 </b>\n",
    "This is a script originally created in October 2019, and reconfigured in March 2024. It takes in Scopus IDs from WMU and WMed researchers and returns author keywords associated with their publications. These keywords, along with ingested keywords from ORCiD profiles, directory pages, departmental research topic websites, and FARS keywords, are then exported in as a csv aggregating researchers by a single research keyword (in the format \"keyword | researcherID(s) | researchName(s) | researcherAffiliation(s)\"). The overarching purpose of this project is to help make connections between researchers with similar interests for expanding interdisciplinary collaboration. The script accomplishes the following actions within each cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>In[1]</b> Imports relevant libraries.\\\n",
    "<i>Note: pybliometrics is not a default python library and will need to be installed first using \"pip install pybliometrics\". Scopus API key will need to be acquired through the Elsevier Developer Portal at http://dev.elsevier.com/myapikey.html, which pybliometrics will prompt you to enter upon library installation to create a configuration file on your system. A InstToken is not required. To obtain the API Key, you will need to log into Scopus with your institutional affiliation. To query the API, users will need to be on campus.</i>\n",
    "For more information about pybliometrics, please see the documentation: https://pybliometrics.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "* <b>In[2]</b> Lists all the .txt and .csv files required within the script. \\\n",
    "These include: a plain text (.txt) file listing all the researcher Scopus IDs, separated by commas (for querying the Scopus API, in the format: \"ScopusID1,ScopusID2...etc\"); a plain text file listing WMU researcher Scopus IDs (for querying the Scopus API, in the format: \"ScopusID1,ScopusID2...etc\"); a comma separated value (.csv) file created by the script in ln[4] that includes a full output of articles along with all the associated metadata for each researcher Scopus ID; a plain text file matching unique researcher IDs to related Scopus IDs (in the format \"ID:ScopusID1; ScopusID2\"); a plain text file matching unique researcher IDs to additional research keywords (in the format \"ID:keywordORCiD; keywordDirectory; keywordFARS\"); a plain text file making unique researcher IDs to researcher names and affiliation (in the format \"ID:researcherName;Dept1 | Dept2\").\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "* <b>In[3]</b> Creates list of ScopusIDs in a format readable by the API. \\\n",
    "Opens the listing of all the researcher Scopus IDs (researcher_ScopusID_list) and reads the contents in, modifying the IDs to include the designation \"Au_ID\" required by ScopusSearch (in ln[4]), and splitting the IDs into items within a list, authors_ids\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "* <b>In[4]</b> Returns articles associated with the ScopusIDs. \\\n",
    "Using the authors_ids list, all the researcher IDs are looped through the Scopus API via ScopusSearch, returning all the articles associated with each Scopus ID. These articles are added to a pandas dataframe, which holds onto the information while the next Scopus ID within the list is used to query the API. The resulting dataframe is exported (\"date_researcher-articles-complete.csv\"), using the date that the script was initialized\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "* <b>In[5]</b> Creates list of WMU ScopusIDs in a format readable by the API. \\\n",
    "Opens the listing of just WMU researcher Scopus IDs (partialresearcher_ScopusID_list) and reads the contents in, modifying the IDs to include the designation \"Au_ID\" required by ScopusSearch, and splitting the IDs into items within a list, partial_authors_ids\n",

    "* <b>In[6]</b> Returns articles associated with only WMU ScopusIDs. \\\n",
    "Using the partial_authors_ids list, only the WMU researcher IDs are looped through the Scopus API via ScopusSearch, returning all the articles associated with each Scopus ID. These articles are added to a pandas dataframe, which holds onto the information while the next Scopus ID within the list is used to query the API. The resulting dataframe is exported (\"date_researcher-articles-WMU.csv\"), using the date that the script was initialized\n",

    "* <b>In[7]</b> Uses script-generated file of all articles associated with ScopusIDs (exported in In[4]). \\\n",
    "The csv with the full Scopus ID articles list (\"date_researcher_articles_list.csv\") is read back into the script as a dataframe outside of querying the API. The dataframe is printed as a check to see if everything is working correctly\n",

    "* <b>In[8]</b> Extracts author keywords from associated ScopusIDs in file (In[7]), merging all keywords across multiple scholarship under one ScopusID. \\\n",
    "A dictionary (aukey_dict) is created from the df_full_articles dataframe, where the Scopus ID (key) is associated with the author keywords (values) from all the articles associated with the Scopus ID. Since author keywords is a user-generated field, it is possible that a researcher may have many articles without any author keywords, and therefore the value for that ID key might be \"nan\" (none). It is also possible that a researcher might have many Scopus IDs if they haven't been merged, and will be represented more than once within this dictionary.\n",

    "* <b>In[9]</b> Replaces ScopusIDs with researcherIDs, merging all ScopusIDs associated with a researcherID into a single entry. \\\n",
    "A txt file associating researcher IDs with their Scopus IDs is read into the script (researcher_scopus). A dictionary, researkey_dict, is created substituting the Scopus ID with researcher IDs as the key, and adding the Scopus author keywords as the values. In the case where a researcher does not have a Scopus ID, then the researcher ID is added to the dictionary without associated values.\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "* <b>In[10]</b> Adds additional research keywords to single researcherID entry. \\\n",
    "A txt file associating researcher IDs with additional keywords from ORCiD, directories, researcher departmental topic websites, Faculty Annual Reporting portal (FARS) is read into the script(researcher_additionalkeywords). The researkey_dict is used as a base to add these additional keywords to Scopus author keyword values already in the dictionary. After, the keywords (values) are de-duplicated. This step also generates an intermediary file (date_WMUresearcher_keywords_affiliation.csv), that exports all the keywords associated with a single researcher.\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "* <b>In[11]</b> Associates single research key with a single researcherID. \\\n",
    "The researkey_dict is then transformed into singleresearkey_dict, where the research keyword list is split up into single units, and each keyword is associated with a researcher ID (W567898:[1,2,3] --> W567898:[1], W567898:[2], W567898:[3])\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "* <b>In[12]</b> Associate single research key with multiple researchIDs, and adds additional context to each researchID. \\\n",
    "A new txt file is read into the script that associates researcher IDs with researcher name and WMU department | WMed department (researcher_affiliation). This is transformed into the uniqueIDaffil_dict, which is then used to add context to the keyresearaffil_dict, which links keywords to researcher IDs, researcher names, and researcher departments. All of the affiliation values are de-duplicated. Keyresear_dict is then transformed into a dataframe (keyresearaffil_dataframe) and the final file is exported (date_WMUresearcher_keywords_affiliation.csv) with a single keyword associated with multiple researchers."
